MyKVocs - A Korean Learning Web-App
=============================================
This application helps Korean learners to extend their Korean vocabulary knowledge.
The plan is to provide the user with the feature to create their vocabulary books.
Also, there will be already set up vocabulary books filled with content from the (in my opinion very good) webpage https://www.howtostudykorean.com/. 
To practice the words the user can use a special 'test' feature targeting one book. 
This feature hides one side of each word (either English or Korean) and the user has to fill it in. 
The result (how many correct/incorrect words) are displayed in the book's description so the user knows in which of his books he has deficits.
