# koreanLearnApp

This application helps korean learners to extend their korean vocabulary knowledge.
The plan is to provide the user with the feature to create own vocabulary books.
Also there will be already set up vocabulary books filled with content from the (in my opinion very good) webpage https://www.howtostudykorean.com/. 
The main learning technique will be a 'test' feature to learn the words in a vocabulary book.
