# koreanLearnApp

This application helps korean learners to extend their korean vocabulary knowledge.
The plan is to provide the user with the feature to create own vocabulary books.
Also there will be already set up vocabulary books filled with content from the (in my opinion very good) webpage https://www.howtostudykorean.com/. 
To practice the words the user can use a special 'test' feature targeting one book. 
This feature hides one side of a word (either english or korean) and the user has to fill it in or skip it. 
The result (how many correct/incorrect) are displayed in the books description so the user knows in which of his books he has deficits.
